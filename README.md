# 1.1.3FlowerGarden
## What works/doesn't work:
Our flower list is "dandelion", "sunflower", "tulip", "daisy", and "lily"
The only input that will properly run in this program is through the format "#_of_Flowers type_of_flower color_name"
the type of flower and color must be written in lower case and must NOT be plural and should be spelled right

### Here is an example of a working input
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e070e7b-bfc2-4caa-9123-3d08dc7c6ca8)

there shouldn't be any extra spaces
This program also only runs once, so in order to retest something you need to re-run it
